    Monkfox is a team of highly experienced IIT-IIM alumni. All of us have been mentors, educationists and entrepreneurs at some point in our lives. We share a common vision, which is to change the look and shape of higher education in the country. The reality today is that the engineering graduates coming out of our colleges are unemployable. A lot of it has to do with the lack of hands-on and practical real-world exposure to the students. At Monkfox we are trying to change that scenario.

</p>
</div>
<div class="text-normal text-center m-5"><p class="m-5">    We conduct various hands-on technology workshops i.e. Student Training Programs (STPs) and Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), we are also actively involved in activities like Career Training, Lab Setup, Mentoring, Certification, Project assistance etc. Some of these workshops are conducted in collaboration with Engineering Colleges and some outside of classrooms. With Monkfox, we have been able to change the lives of more than 15000 engineering students studying in more than 150 engineering colleges. Also, with our Faculty Development Programs, we have had the opportunity to interact with more than 1000 faculty members all over India. Some of the advanced technology workshops which we have conducted include Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Robotics, Python and Blockchain. Apart from these advanced technical workshops, we also conduct programs to reaffirm the engineering fundamentals like Zero to Hero Coder, Operating System Fundamentals, Civil engineering fundamentals, Hydraulics and Pneumatics.

We all are going to experience a drastic change in the job market in the years to come. In the next 5 years, 70% of the existing jobs will vanish and several new jobs will get created. Developing countries like China, Brazil etc are investing heavily in education and specifically on advance skill education. As a country, we need to remain relevant to the current and future job market. We need to be able to attract more and more jobs to sustain our growing population. The only answer to this is reskilling. We need to start investing our time, energy and money towards preparing our future workforce for jobs which are going to come. With Monkfox we are taking this challenge head-on and making sure that students joining the job market are adding value to their companies right from day one.
